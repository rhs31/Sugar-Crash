Miami Dade College Magic Game Jam 2018 Entry

This is MOST of the code for a project made in ~20 hours for the Miami Dade College Magic Game Jam in September of 2018. 

It is NOT the final build, as it is missing the startup menu as well as the music. That version is sitting on a different computer, and thus is not yet added to this repo. The core gameplay is all here, however.
